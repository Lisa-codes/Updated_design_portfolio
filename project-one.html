                        Village Market.
                        This app allows users to effortlessly book their sessions and make payments, integrating a seamless

                        with a QR code system to easily add friends and enjoy games together. The app also simplifies the
                        booking process,
                        making it easier for users to explore match types and tournaments, while tracking their scores for
                        each game played.

            <h4>Lack of Dedicated Court Booking</h4>
            <p>
                Users struggled to **find Village Market courts** on PlayAtomic due to its generalized approach. 
                Without a **dedicated space**, they had to sift through multiple listings, leading to confusion and frustration.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-card slide-left" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
            <h4>Unreliable Availability Updates</h4>
            <p>
                Many players reported **misleading court availability**, only to realize upon checkout that their slot was taken. 
                The lack of **real-time updates** resulted in a broken booking experience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-card slide-left" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
            <h4>Limited Game Progress Tracking</h4>
            <p>
                Players wanted a way to **track past matches, scores, and progress**, but existing platforms lacked 
                a personalized history. This **gap in performance tracking** reduced engagement and motivation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-card slide-left" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
            <h4>Inefficient Time Selection</h4>
            <p>
                Users found it **cumbersome to select available time slots**, often having to go back and forth between screens.  
                The lack of a **clear scheduling system** made the process tedious and prone to errors.

            <h4>Reducing Booking Confusion</h4>
            <p>
                While PlayAtomic excels in navigation and match discovery, its open-platform approach led to confusion when locating specific courts like 
                Village Market. Our solution streamlines this by offering a **dedicated booking space**, minimizing uncertainty.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="research-card slide-left" style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">
            <h4>Personalized Booking Alerts</h4>
            <p>
                Users reported frustration when a previously viewed court became fully booked. To **mitigate misleading availability**, we introduced 
                **smart notifications**, alerting players when slots fill up, ensuring they always have up-to-date information.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="research-card slide-left" style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">
            <h4>Autonomous Score Tracking</h4>
            <p>
                Unlike PlayAtomic, which lacks built-in tracking, our app empowers users with a **personalized game history**. Players can **log scores, 
                track progress, and monitor rankings**, creating a more engaging and competitive environment.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="research-card slide-left" style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">
            <h4>Seamless Time Selection</h4>
            <p>
                Users needed a more intuitive way to book matches. We introduced a **time slot filter and a sliding calendar**, allowing players to 
                **effortlessly select day, time, and month**, enhancing the booking flow based on real user behaviors.

            <p class="text-center">
                In the Padel Tennis mobile app, the user flow begins with the Sign-Up process, where users are
                prompted to create an
                account by entering their basic information, such as name, email, and password, or by signing in
                using third-party
                authentication options like Google or Email. Once signed up, users proceed to the Home Screen,
                which presents
                available tennis courts, match schedules, and upcoming tournaments. From here, they can navigate to
                the Booking Section,
                where they select a court, choose a date and time, and confirm their booking.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                Next, users are directed to the Payment Screen, where they can view the booking summary and make
                payments through
                integrated payment methods such as credit/debit cards, mobile wallets, or other available options.
                Upon successful
                payment, the user receives an Instant Notification confirming their booking details, which includes
                the court number,
                time slot, and any other relevant instructions. The app also allows users to receive notifications
                for upcoming matches
                or changes to their booking. This seamless flow ensures a user-friendly experience, from account
                creation to court
                booking and payment completion, with real-time notifications keeping the user informed throughout.

        <p>
            One of the primary challenges of this project was the need to deliver a fully functional app within a tight
            timeline.
            To address this, we prioritized the development of core features such as the booking system, QR code
            integration, and
            score tracking. Rapid prototyping allowed for quick iterations, ensuring that each design element was
            validated before
            moving on to the next stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final product successfully streamlined the booking process, enhanced user interaction with QR code
            functionalities,
            and provided an intuitive interface for tracking game scores.

            The Padel Tennis Mobile App was designed with a user-first approach, ensuring that every interaction was seamless, intuitive, and tailored to the needs of Village Market players. Through a combination of foundational research, competitive analysis, 
            and user feedback, we successfully bridged the gaps left by existing solutions, providing a dedicated,
             hassle-free booking and tracking system. <br>
            Key Takeaways:
            <ul class="text-left" style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>✅ User-Centered Innovation: Addressing pain points such as court availability confusion, personalized reminders, and time-slot selection improved usability and engagement.</li>
                <li>✅ Consistency in Design: A well-defined design system ensured uniformity, accessibility, and a visually appealing interface.</li>
           <li>  ✅ Scalability & Future Growth: While the app is tailored for Village Market, its framework allows for future expansion, additional feature integrations, and enhanced user experiences.</li>
            </ul>
            
            By combining intuitive UX, strategic problem-solving, and a refined design system, this project exemplifies how thoughtful digital experiences can enhance real-world activities—making booking, playing, and tracking Padel Tennis matches more effortless than ever.
