                <h2>Bowling Queue System </h2>
                <p>
                    As the Lead UI/UX Designer, I developed an internal bowling queue system to efficiently manage high-traffic
                    days at the Village Market mall's bowling alley. This system was created to streamline the booking process,
                    making it easier for staff to handle large client volumes, particularly during peak times such as public
                    holidays and weekends.
                    Key features include "notified/pending" status bars for tracking ticket information and clickable lane cards
                    for editing lane occupancy. The design adheres to WCAG guidelines, ensuring consistency and accessibility.
                    The project was completed within a week, from June 7th to June 14th, and was designed to be used by
                    administrators only, who were the target end users. The final product proved to be seamless, user-friendly,
                    accessible, and easy to use.

            <h3 class="text-center pb-4">Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                Due to the project’s tight timeline, a rapid prototyping approach was utilized to quickly iterate
                and refine the design based on feedback. Initial wireframes were created to map out the user flow,
                focusing on ease of use and quick navigation for the bowling alley staff. High-fidelity mockups
                followed, which were crucial in visualizing the final product before development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design process was centered around the end users—the administrators—ensuring that the interface
                was intuitive and aligned with their daily tasks. The emphasis was on accessibility, following WCAG
                guidelines to make the system usable for all staff members, regardless of any potential limitations.

    <!-- User Flow Section -->
    <h4 class="text-center mt-5">User Flow</h4>
    <p>
        The user flow for the bowling queue system starts when an administrator logs into the system. The admin can
        view available lanes, check the status of active games, and manage new bookings. The system’s flow ensures
        the seamless transition from booking to lane assignment, real-time notifications, and daily performance
        reporting. Below is a visual representation of the user flow:

                        and managing lane occupancy efficiently.

                The bowling queue system had a significant impact on the operational performance of the bowling alley. Below
                are the key metrics showcasing the improvement after official handing over to the developers and successful

            <h3 class="text-center pb-4">Future Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                Moving forward, a key improvement I would implement is adding a user journey from the sign-up process for
                administrators. Given the time-sensitive nature of the project, the system was initially designed with the
                assumption that all users were already logged in as administrators. However, introducing a sign-up and login
                feature would enhance the system’s security and provide a more structured user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, expanding the system's functionality to include detailed user profiles for each administrator
                could further streamline operations by tracking individual performance and usage statistics. This would
                provide valuable insights for management while improving the overall efficiency of the bowling alley
                operations.
